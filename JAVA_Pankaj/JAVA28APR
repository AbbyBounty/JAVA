Constructor example:

when object is created constructor will call.

public class A {
    A(int i)
    {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    A a1= new A(100);
      
    }
}

+++++
->If we write "void" in front of constructor then it will no longer constructor , it will be method.
->if we do not add constructor in our program then during compilation .class file auto empty body const get added 
->we can create more than one const in a class but with diff no of argu or diff type of arg./
